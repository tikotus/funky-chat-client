A funky chat client

Choose a name and chat on channels.

There are two different kind of channels: Joined and available. Joined channels are the one
you have joined. You will see messages sent to these channels after you joined it. Available
channels are channels others have joined. You can't see messages sent to available channels
before you joined it. A future improvement would be to download old messages from a cache
when you join a channel.

Join new channels with '/join [chan]'

Change name with '/nick [name]'

Build with

```
npm run build
```
